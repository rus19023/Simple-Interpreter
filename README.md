# extence-c
Lol this is brocken now thinking to stop working on this because I want to work on a Json copy from scratch :(

Want to mixe up c and shell script which will look like shell script and act like kinda python and c++ hope will go well :);

How you can work in this ? 

1. Fork the repository.
2. Edite ec.c file as you want as the features you want into the language.
3. Request pull into the project (I will check and aprove).

Want to test ? 

    1. Use open command promt or terminal run the command ./ec filename
    2. filename will be the name of your text file

What can you do right now ?

    1. For now you have only print function to print some string in console
        Syntax -> print "string" (/n to add next line and /t for tab)
    
Thanks for look over the repo :) Have a nice day
